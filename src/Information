Programming:

The goal of this project is to provide educational materials on the spread of viruses due to the prevalence of COVID-19
and the spread of misinformation. This simulation will show the virus can spread when precautions are ignored and the
consequences on the general population as well as at-risk populations.

Initial project will incorporate basic factors (ignores race, age, and other influential factors). The simulation will
consist of points that represents individuals that will move around and interact with other points. An infected point
will have a chance to spread the infection (ignoring if they are symptomatic for now).

Before implementing the simulation, do some research and the spread of the virus to accurately reflect the real-world situation.
Do not worry about the GUI-implementation.

kdtree.Point class:
 - Represents an individual (can represents group in the future)
 - - Individuals cannot occupy the same coordinates
 - Since there will be many points and have to search, use a graph that updates the distance? with a priority queue
 - - Need a way to keep track of the distance between points and be able to update them as the points move around

 - A point can be masked (reduces the chance of spreading or getting the virus)
 - A point can be infected (infected points cannot receive the virus again until they have been cleared)
 - - Incubation period if 5 - 6 days, ranging from 3 to 13 days before showing symptoms
 - - - Being immunocompromised does not mean increased probability of getting infected, but means that death if higher
 - - Re-infection can occur
 - - Can be asymptomatic (no documented asymptomatic transmission)

Temp: do not keep track of homes or families (yet)
Every tick, the simulation will update and the point will move by zero or one unit
- Use a PQ to keep track of the future destination of the point since they cannot occupy the same spots
- Every tick, symptomatic individuals will have chance to "sneeze" and spread the infection
- - Tick is 1 second and represents 1 day (for now)
- - individuals within 6 units will have a chance of becoming infected (more research)

Global position chart that keeps track of current points positions
Updated position chart that keeps track of future points positions
After each point moves, use a PQ to keep track of the closest points
- - If infected point sneezes, everyone in the PQ that are within 6 units can be infected
- - Future update, only add points that are nearby

Infected points have small probability of becoming severely infected and high probability to die

When updating the current positions, use a PQ and give priority to points that need to be updated to avoid edge case
